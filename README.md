To use this Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open within your browser next to your webpage. There you will see a list of topics we learned from Prework along with a suggestion on which topic you should study first. If you already studied the suggested topic sufficiently, try refreshing the page to receive another suggestion! (If you get the same result multiple times continue to refresh as it randomly chooses from the 4 options each time)
